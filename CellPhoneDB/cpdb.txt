This is an instruction on how to run CellPhoneDB on BioHPC. CellPhoneDB is used for cell-cell communication. Please visit https://www.cellphonedb.org for more information
Before running this script, please make sure CellPhoneDB is installed properly using cpdb_install.txt and the neccessary input files are created using one of the cpdb.R scripts provided.

To run the actual CellPhoneDB analysis:
```
module load python/3.7.x-anaconda
source cpdb-venv/bin/activate
cd /path/to/directory/

cellphonedb method statistical_analysis sample_meta.txt sample_counts.txt
```

To generate plots from CellPhoneDB analysis:
Plot outputs are ggplot2 plots, so make sure ggplot2 is installed in your R.
```
module load R/4.0.2-gccmkl python/3.7.x-anaconda
source cpdb-venv/bin/activate
export LD_PRELOAD=/cm/shared/apps/python/3.7.x-anaconda/lib/libmkl_core.so:/cm/shared/apps/python/3.7.x-anaconda/lib/libmkl_sequential.so
cd /path/to/directory/

cellphonedb plot dot_plot
cellphonedb plot heatmap_plot sample_meta.txt
```

For more indepth breakdown of plots please see https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb.
All plots can be adjusted using ggplot2 functions as well.
